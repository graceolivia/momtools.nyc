# momtools.nyc

I'm a stay at home mom in new york city and I also really miss coding and I also wanted to learn to use AI tools. So this is the synthesis of these: my momtools.nyc project. I'm trying to both curate and create tools that are personally useful to moms, sahms, and nyc sahms. This will link to my own projects from other repos and cool stuff that I use that I think you will like.
